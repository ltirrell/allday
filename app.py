Data was queried using the [Flipside ShroomDK](https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk) using [this query template](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/sql/sdk_allday.sql), acquiring all the sales data and metadata from the Flow tables.
Data is saved to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday) ([data collection script](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/gather_data.py), [data directory](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/data)).
The script is currently manually ran at least once per week (to get new data for each NFL week).
Note that there may be some difference between this data (such as average sales price/number of sales) and what is listed at the NFL All Day Marketplace.

NFL stats information was obtained from [`nfl_data_py`](https://github.com/cooperdff/nfl_data_py).
See [here](https://github.com/nflverse/nflreadr/blob/bf1dc066c18b67823b9293d8edf252e3a58c3208/data-raw/dictionary_playerstats.csv) for a description of most metrics.
Season and play-by-play data, available since 1999, was used for determining whether of a player or play resulted in a score.

To determine whether a Moment NFT contains a video of a Touchdown score, the following information was used:
- **Description only (Moment TD)**: The Moment Description in the Flipside Data contains either of both of the case-insensitive words "TD" or "touchdown". This results in many false classifications, but is a good starting point without watching each video to determine the TD status.
- **Conservative (Moment TD)**: Play-by-play data was used to determine if the play in the Moment resulted in a TD. This is possible as the Quarter, clock time, and game information (season, week and teams) are available in the NFT metadata, and can be watch with what occurred at that game time. A few times (~15) did not match up, and these videos were watched to determine their TD status. All plays from seasons before 1999 would have a NaN/Null value for this determination, as play-by-play data is not available.
- **Conservative (In-game TD)**: Using NFT data regarding the player and the game, the seasonal NFL stats are checked to determine whether a player scored in that game. All plays from seasons before 1999 would have a NaN/Null value for this determination, as season data is not available.
- **Best Guess (Moment TD)**: This is the the same as **Conservative (Moment TD)** if it is not NaN, or else will match the **Description only (Moment TD)**. However, if **Conservative (In-game TD)** is False (meaning the seasonal stats data says the player didn't score that game), then this value will be False.
- **Best Guess: (In-game TD)**: This is the same as **Conservative (In-game TD)** if it is not NaN, or else will match the **Description only (Moment TD)**.

Game outcome was obtained using information from the NFT metadata-- the Home and Away team scores are available.
This is used to determine if the player's team won the game, or it resulted in a tie.

A [Bonferroni-corrected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) [2-sided Welch's t-test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) was used to determine whether TD scoring Moments had more sales or a higher price than those not scoring TDs.
The same was done for game winners/losers additionally.

A [Linear Mixed Effects Model](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/mixed_lm_example.html#) was used to determine which variables are predictive of a Moment's price, using the following model:
```
Price ~ Q("Scored Touchdown?") + Q("Game outcome") + Play_Type + Position + Rarity + (1|marketplace_id)
```
where 
- `Scored Touchdown` is whether the NFT contains a TD score based on the **Best Guess (Moment TD)** method
- `Game outcome` is whether the team won or lost
- `Play type` is one of the play types that could result in a TD (such as pass or rush)
- `Position` is the player's position
- `Rarity` is the Moment Tier, turned into a number from 0-3 (0 is COMMON, 3 is ULTIMATE)
- `marketplace_id` is the random effect, used to group the sales information based on this value. For example, [marketplace_id 1015](https://nflallday.com/listing/moment/1015) would group all of the sales for all of the 60 different Stephon Diggs Moment NFT IDs. NFT ID wasn't used, as all of them are the same (i.e. there are no features of an NFT with the same marketplace_id which vary by NFT ID).
Details can found in [this notebook](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/what_drives_price.ipynb).

The [XGBoost Python Package](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/index.html) was used to determine feature importance using [this notebook](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/xgboost.ipynb).
Overall, the model explains about 69.2 percent of variance in the data (based on r^2 score); this isn't very accurate for prediction but is sufficient for determining which features most effect NFT Price.

Paired 2-tailed t-tests were computed for various metrics to assess whether the average number of sales and sales price show differences in certain condions (such as before vs during a challenge).
Price data for a week was grouped by `marketplace_id` (the unique id for each Moment, while `NFT_ID` is the unique item within a marketplace_id; the number of `NFT_ID`s per `marketplace_id` is up to the `total_circulation` value).

Data was queried using the [Flipside ShroomDK](https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk) using [this](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/sql/sdk_packs.sql) and [this](https://github.com/ltirrell/allday/blob/round5/sql/sdk_reveals.sql)  query template, acquiring data for when packs were purchased, and when the NFTs within the Pack were revealed.

            - `During Game`: Data during the game period (between red lines)
            - `Post Game 1D`: Data for 1 day after the game period
            - `During Challenge`: Data during the Challenge period (between gray lines)

            - `Post Challenge 1D`: Data for 1 day after the Challenge period
            These numbers are mostly descriptive.
            Future analyses can explore this timeseries data in more detail, taking into account that specific players (who probably have notable games) show clear trends while others do not.

                Below is a breakdown of Pack drops given as rewards for completing challenges.

                In NFL All Day, Challenges pay out Yards which count towards a user's playbook.
                Depending on how many yards a user earns at the end of a week, the user gets a Pack dropped to them at a certain star level.

                This works out to approximately one star per challenge completed (though other tasks are necessary, such as logging on to the website).

                Gaining a higher level pack means the users also gets the lower level packs (so earning a 3-star pack would mean the user also earns a 1- and 2- star pack).

                The floor price is listed, as well is the cost for eligibility for pack rewards (generally burning 5 Moments).

    - Date Range: Sales data for All Time, since the current NFL season started, or specific weeks of this season
    - Play Types: we're mainly interested in whether a TD scored in the moment leads to a higher price, so choose a specific play type where scoring is possible, or look at all of them!
    - Method: Method used for determining whether the Moment encapsulates a TD score. See [Methods](#methods) for details.
    - Position Type: Divide results by Player's Positon, the Position Group, or Rarity level of the NFT
    - Game Metric: Color the points by whether the NFT contains a TD score, or whether the Player's team won the game. If Both are chosen, color is used for showing TD scoring and shape is used for showing game outcome.
    - Aggregation Metric: Plot the Average Sales Price of the NFT, or the Sales Count

    `Ctrl-Click` a point to open the the NFL All Day Marketplace page for an NFT in a new tab.
    *Note the log scale of the y-axis!*

    Last we'll look at whether recent higher performing players have increased number of sales, or higher median or mean price.
    We'll use NFL stats for the players from a specific date range (the entire 2022 season, or from a specific week), and sort players by a given metric.
    Fantasy Points is used by default; while this isn't the best metric of a player, those who score high generally had big games.
    Players of all positions can be used, or you can select one of the available positions.
    Use the slider to select how many players to view.

    Top Players will show up in large circles in the chart below, and their NFT sales are compared with other players in the same timeframe.
    Explore all the different possible combinations!
    **Generally, the top players have increased sales and average price compared to the rest of the league**.

    `Ctrl-Click`ing a circle will open the video of the first Moment sold for that player on that day.

            To analyze whether Players themselves or the Play Type captured in the Moment lead to more value, we used XGBoost to determine feature importance of our data.
            See [Methods](#methods) below for more details. Our model included 
            - `Player` name for the top 35 Players, with the remaining Players grouped into a `Player_Other` category
            - `Team` name for the top 6 Teams, with the remaining Teams grouped into a `Team_Other` category
            - `Position` name for the top 3 Postions, with the remaining Positions grouped into a `Postions_Other` category
            - `Play_Type` name for the top 4 Play_Types, with the remaining Play_Types grouped into a `Play_Type_Other` category
            - `Rarity`, coding the Moment Tier as an integer in increasing order of rarity
            - `Sales_Count`: the number of times a specific NFT is sold (e.g. if an NFT was sold 3 times, this number would be 3 for all rows of data)
            - `Resell Number`: for a specific transaction, the number of times that each specific NFT was resold (e.g. for the first ransaction of an NFT, this would be 0; if the same NFT was then purchased again, the second sale would have a value of 1)
            We used these features to determine the price of the NFT, determining which factors are best indicators of predicting the sale price of an NFT.

            We used 2 measures to assess feature importance: [gain](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html#xgboost.Booster.get_score) (how much a feature contributed to the model), and [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) (an approach for explaining output of machine learning models) (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59007136) for a discussion of determining feature importance).

            Note: A feature is just a [measurable property of our data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)), such as whether the NFT is from a specific player.

            While the methods have some differences, both generally agree that **Player**, **Position** and **Rarity** are most importantant, while **Play_Type** is lower down on ranking.

            This makes sense, as average prices jump drastically as rarity increases, and as we saw above, certain specific players or position groups were among the highest average price.

            Figure 1:
            - Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, and several other QBs (as well as the position of QB itself) are highest on the list. That is, whether you are one of these players or not contributes the predicting the price of an NFT.
            - Rarity is the 4th ranked feature
            - The first `Play_type` is ranked around 25, showing that this has little relative effect in determining NFT price compared to Players

            Figure 2:
            - `Rarity`, followed by being a Player outside the top 35 or position outside the top 3 (not a QB, RB or Team-based Moment) explain the NFT the most
            - The number sales, and the resell number for NFTs also show value in determining price. Generally, people would like to resell at a profit (maybe investigated in a future analysis?) so more sales of a specific NFT may lead to a higher price overall.
            - Whether the Moment is of Tom Brady still has an important effect on explaining price.
            - `Play_Type_Interception` has the 8th highest mean SHAP value. Play Type appears higher in this method of explaining importance, but still below many Player-related categories

            Some examples of interactions between features are shown below, described in clockwise from the top left:
            1. If an NFT has the feature `Player_Other` (red), our model would predict its price is lower for higher Rarity levels.
            2. The opposite effect is seen for `Position_QB`: for higher rarities, a QB NFT would be predicted to be hgiher.
            3. While more mixed, the the previous 2 charts, NFTs for `Position_Other` have higher prices at Rarity 1 (Rare), but lower prices at Rarity 2 (Legendary)
            4. `Play_Type_Interception` is similar to `Player_Other`: NFTs of this type are lower than those not of inteceptions at igher Rarity values.
            5. If an NFT is `Player_Other` (not a top-35 player by importance) and is a QB, its price is predicted to be lower.
            6. For `Play_Type Rush`, if a player is not `Position_Other` (so either QB, RB or Team), an NFT would be predicted to have lower value if the NFT shows a Rushing play.
